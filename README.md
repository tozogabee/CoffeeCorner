Charlene's Coffee Corner
Recently, Charlene decided to open her very own little coffee shop on a busy street corner.
Being the careful entrepreneur, she decided to start off with a limited offering, with the option to expand her choice of products, as
business goes.


Her Offering
- Coffee (small, medium, large) 2.50 CHF, 3.00 CHF, 3.50 CHF
- Bacon Roll 4.50 CHF
- Freshly squeezed orange juice (0.25l) 3.95 CHF


Extras:
- Extra milk 0.30 CHF
- Foamed milk 0.50 CHF
- Special roast coffee 0.90 CHF

Bonus Program
  Charlene's idea is to attract as many regularâ€˜s as possible to have a steady turnaround.
  She decides to offer a customer stamp card, where every 5th beverage is for free.
  If a customer orders a beverage and a snack, one of the extra's is free.
  Your task is to:
  Write a simple program whose output is formatted like a receipt you would receive at a supermarket.
  The input to the program is a list of products the shopper wants to purchase (large coffee with extra milk, small coffee with special roast,
  bacon roll, orange juice)
  Important:
- The only libraries which can be used are Java SE (any version) and JUnit (any version)
- Test Driven Development (TDD) is the recommended approach. In any case the solution must have automated tests
- There is no Graphical User Interface required and no persistence. It's a simple program
- If you come across an ambiguous requirement, make a sensible assumption and proceed
  Please deliver all artefacts, so the program and tests can be executed and make them available via Github or bitbucket (our
  Email server otherwise blocks them)
